# How To Have a One-on-One Meeting

- the consulting : when people bring you a dataset they don't fully understand and have to figure out what to do 

- initial discussion (an investigation): figure out what kind of question they want to ask, what do they already know, what do they think they can answer, what data they have in hand, what data do they think they'll have, how likely is that to happen, constraints on data? who's in charge of that?
- checklist of questions!

- follow-up discussions: report on what you've done (educate them AND why you did it; how you did it, what potential limitations; AND get a read on their understanding/interpretation, welcome all questions) ; know what questions you need to ask them to further clarify analysis, 

Things that commonly go wrong:
* initial meeting: they miscommunicate (intentionally or unintentionally), won't be specific enough, don't know what they want (be prepared to have ideas to get them on the right track, solutions) 
* follow-up meetings : data don't show what the person hoped, there's missing things that you didn't have would need to accomplish what they wanted, they don't understand/misinterpret

Really hammer this home: the process is what matters not the result. It's a challenge. Ethics is more important than results. Don't succumb to the Pressure  - it's ok to push back
